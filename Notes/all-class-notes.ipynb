In the first section, the author examines a theory that has been popular over the last few years. Using a projection model based on those factors, an estimated number of wins is calculated. It is hoped that the results and the relevant analysis will inform the reader about their importance and accuracy as a measure of success.\n",

    "At first look, it seems that the claim about their importance is quite fair. If a team is efficient in those statistical categories, it is more likely that it will earn wins. However, it is very far from reality. All teams were projected to have between 121 and 179 wins, while the total number of games is 82. The initial coefficiencts are not correct in that case, neither the standard error is taken into consideration. \n",
