    "- You can add either\n",
    "  - A high usage scorer with average defense\n",
    "  - A lower-usage 3&D Wing with strong defense\n",

    "### Player-Level Impact for Their Role\n",
    "- Core Concept: Evaluate players within the context of the role they will have on your team\n",
    "- Example\n",
    "  - Primary Creators - Playmaking, advantage creation weighted more heavily than rebounding\n",
    "  - 3&D Wing - 3PT%, matchup difficulty, positional versatility weighted more than creating own shot\n",
    "\n",
    "### Player-Level Immpact: Stylistic Fit & Scalability\n",
    "- Fit\n",
    "  - How a Player Likes to Play vs How Your Team Plays\n",
    "  - Scheme fit on both ends (P/R Level, Help vs 1-on-1 Defense, Small vs Big Lineups)\n",
    "- Scalability\n",
    "  - Can they maintain or increase efficiency next to different stars?\n",
    "  - Do their strengths complement your core players?\n",

    "- Playoff availability and performance history in high-leverage games\n",
    "- *A great player who is rarely available is a risky investment*\n",

    "### Player Acquisition Scenario\n",
    "You already have two high-usage stars. Offense is Top 10, Defense is slightly below average. Would you rather acquire\n",
    "1. Player A: 22PPG, High-Usage, Average Efficiency, Limited Defense\n",
    "2. Player B: 11PPG, Low-Usage, Elite Spot-Up Shooting, Strong Team Defender\n",

    "What if the Team Context changes?\n",

    "Team Context: You are a 4-5 Seed trying to become a *true contender*. You can commit a multi-year contract to\n",
    "1. Player C: Stable Production for 4+ yyears, modest growth, reliable floor\n",
