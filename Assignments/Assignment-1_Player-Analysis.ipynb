    "## Introduction\n",
    "This analysis examines player performance across varying roles and levels of offensive involvement during the 2024–2025 NBA season. The goal is to evaluate how players of different usage profiles contribute to their teams through both basic and advanced statistical metrics — identifying not just what they produce, but how efficiently they do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "All data used in this report was gathered from NBA.com’s official statistics portal, which provides publicly available data through its player stats API. After obtaining the full dataset for the 2024–2025 season, the data was filtered to include only players meeting the assignment criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. One player averaging 20 or more points per game (primary scorer)\n",
    "2. One player averaging fewer than 10 points per game but logging 25 or more minutes per game (high-minute, low-scoring contributor)\n",
    "3. One player averaging fewer than 10 minutes per game (limited rotation or developmental player)\n",
    "\n",
    "By analyzing these three player profiles, the report aims to demonstrate how usage rate, scoring efficiency, and play style manifest differently depending on a player’s offensive role and opportunity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each selected player, we’ll examine:\n",
    "1. Usage Rate and Scoring Efficiency — understanding how frequently they are involved in offensive possessions and how effectively they convert opportunities.\n",
    "2. Strengths and Weaknesses — identifying 2–3 areas of clear impact and 2–3 areas where statistical trends suggest room for improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this comparison, we’ll uncover insights into how context, role, and efficiency metrics intersect to shape player value beyond traditional box-score averages."

    "## Cade Cunningham\n",
    "- Player Name: Cade Cunningham\n",
    "- Season: 2024-2025\n",
    "- Team: Detroit Pistons\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Stats:\n",
    "- Games Played (GP): 70\n",
    "- Minutes Per Game (MPG): 35.0\n",
    "- Points Per Game (PPG): 26.1\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage & Scoring Efficiency Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- Shot Attempts: 23.13\n",
    "- Usage Rate: 33.18%\n",
    "- Effective Field Goal: 52.16%\n",
    "- True Shooting: 56.42%\n",
    "-----\n",
    "### Strengths & Weaknesses\n",
    "Cunningham’s 33.18 % usage rate places him among the league’s highest, indicating that roughly one of every three team possessions ends with him taking a shot, drawing a foul, or committing a turnover. Despite that workload, his 52.16 % eFG % and 56.42 % TS % remains very good, reflecting solid efficiency under heavy defensive pressure on the Detroit Pistons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strengths\n",
    "\n",
    "Strength 1 - High Offensive Responsibility and Solid Efficiency: Cade Cunningham has a high-offensive responsibility and has solid efficiency. Cunningham averages at about a 33% Usage Rate, and maintains a 56% TS%. This places him at a Top-Ten % of NBA Players in terms of usage, and his TS% puts him in player comparisons between Luka Doncic and Jayson Tatum. \n",
    "\n",
    "Strength 2 - Three-Level Scoring: Cade Cunningham averages about 23 Shot Attempts per game. Looking at the data from NBA.com, Cunningham has a wide variety of shots from the field, and he goes to the line about 5 times a game. He is deadly from inside the paint shooting 53.9% from less-than-8ft away from the basket. \n",
    "\n",
    "Strength 3 - Durability and Conditioning: Cunningham played 70 games at 35 MPG, which shows his excellent stamina and consistency. The coaches and team can rely on him for sustained minutes and late-game creation. This is crucial for a player with a high Usage rate of 33%. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weaknesses\n",
    "\n",
    "Weakness 1 - Efficiency vs Volume Tradeoff: Although 56.4% TS% is respectable, it is still below average for players that qualify for this question, which is 59.1% TS%. \n",
    "\n",
    "Weakness 2 - Reliance on Difficult Shot Creation: The high Usage Rate of 33% often forces Cunningham into self-created attempts late in the shot clock. His 52% eFG% suggests he could benefit from more catch-and-shoot or assisted looks. Last season, Cunningham was assisted by Jalen Duren the most with 55 assists. With Jaden Ivey returning to the Pistons as a secondary creator, this could help Cunningham’s game by lowering his Usage Rate and increasing his eFG%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weakness 3 (Optional) - Offensive Turnover Pressure: High-usage guards naturally generate more turnovers, and Cade Cunningham is no exception. Cunningham averages 4.4 TOVs per game, which is the second-highest in the league. Reducing live-ball turnovers and improving decision-speed and decision-making could elevate his efficiency even further."

    "### Strengths & Weaknesses\n",
    "Bub Carrington was a rookie guard for the 2024-2025 Washington Wizards, and he was a consistent rotational contributor who logged heavy minutes across a full, 82-game season. Though his scoring volume was modest, his availability, discipline, and role execution made him a reliable fixture in Washington’s backcourt rotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strengths\n",
    "\n",
    "Strength 1 - Consistency and Availability: Bub Carrington appeared in all 82 games, and he averaged 30 minutes per night. That consistency allowed him to build rhythm and gain valuable in-game experience, especially as an NBA rookie.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strength 2 - Role Discipline and Complementary Play: Carrington’s Usage Rate of 15.7% shows he doesn’t force the offense, and he stays within the team structure. He contributes through off-ball movement, secondary playmaking (4.4 ASTs), and spacing (33.9% 3P% - around league average for rookies), for higher-usage players like Jordan Poole.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strength 3 - Foundational Shooting Mechanics and Confidence: Despite the modes 50% eFG%, Carrington displayed a willingness to play in a limited-role, and he made the most of his chances with open looks and a balanced shot profile. He averaged 1.7 3PMs per game, which suggests a solid foundation for efficiency and growth as he continues to gain experience in the league.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weaknesses\n",
    "\n",
    "Weakness 1 - Limited Scoring Efficiency: Carrington’s 51.36% TS% lags behind the league average of 57%. This signals that he struggles to convert possessions into efficient points. Improving finishing at the rim, drawing more fouls, and improving his 3PM% could raise his scoring impact and TS%. \n",
    "\n",
    "Weakness 2 - Low Offensive Aggression: A Usage Rate under 16% indicates a lack of assertiveness in creating shots. Again, the role assigned to him didn’t require high volume, he could attack more off-the-drible or in pick-and-roll actions to make himself less predictable and add value to the offense. An increased role with Jordan Poole leaving this off-season could help with Carrington gaining that confidence and comfortability in that aspect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weakness 3 - Developing Rim Pressure and Physicality: Carrington relies heavily on jumpers; limited rim attempts and free-throw trips constrain his efficiency ceiling. Carington made 55-out-of-110 FGAs less-than-5ft from-the-basket, and he made 99-295 FGAs between 25-29 ft away from-the-basket. In addition, he averaged 1 FTA per game. Introducing a more varied shot diet could help in his efficiency, and getting to the basket more can help get him to the line more.\n"

    "### Strengths & Weaknesses\n",
    "As a low-minute rookie for the Indiana Pacers, Johnny Furphy filled a specialist-type role, focused on spacing-the-floor and providing situational shooting off-the-bench. His small sample size limits statistical stability, but the metrics offer an early look at his offensive profile and developmental trajectory. It's important to note that his Per 36 estimates indicate that given a larger role, he could be averaging close to 10 PTS per game, which aligns closely with other low-usage role players who provide spacing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strengths\n",
    "\n",
    "Strength 1 - Floor Spacing and Shooting Confidence: Johnny Furphy’s offensive role is focused on perimeter spacing as he averaged 30% from 3P%, 1 3PA, and 1.8 FGAs per game - meaning half of his shots were from downtown. With his limited minutes, he showed his willingness to accept a role, take open threes, and help the team win. He embodied sacrifice. His 47% eFG% is below average, but it is not alarming or detrimental given his specific role and small sample of attempts \n",
    "\n",
    "Strength 2 - Low-Mistake Role Player: A 12% Usage Rate and minimal TOVs (0.2 TOVs per game) indicate Furphy rarely forces the offense; rather, he flows with the offense. He stays within the system, making simple reads and contributing to the Pacers’ ball movement. \n",
    "\n",
    "Strength 3 - Developmental Potential as a Specialist: Note that Furphy is just 20-years-old, and he is coming into his second-year in the NBA. He will be returning to an Indiana Pacers team with low-expectations due to injuries to their star guard, Tyrese Haliburton, and off-season losses in Myles Turner. This could pose an increased role for Furphy as he displays foundational tools in length, shooting touch, and positional size. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weaknesses\n",
    "\n",
    "Weakness 1 - Limited Offensive Impact: Furphy only averages 1.98 Shot Attempts per game. Increasing activity through cuts, off-ball screens, or offensive rebounds would make him a more dynamic threat in low-minute stints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weakness 2 - Below-Average Shooting Efficiency: A 47% eFG% and 53% TS% are below league benchmarks for shooting specialists. Furphy will need to improve his catch-and-shoot consistency and learn to adjust to NBA close-outs. These will be key to solidifying his identity as a floor spacer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weakness 3 - Defensive Physicality and Strength: Furphy needs to improve his on-ball defense (0.4 STLs and 0.2 BLKs) and rebounding (1.4 REBs) to stay on-the-floor. Greater strength and awareness will translate his athletic tools and create consistent rotation minutes for himself."
