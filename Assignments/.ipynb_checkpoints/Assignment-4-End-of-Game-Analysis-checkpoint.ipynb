    "Using the given NBA Win Probability Calculator [inpredictable](https://stats.inpredictable.com/nba/wpCalc.php), (Q4, 1:37, 1, Y) the **Win Probability** for the **Boston Celtics** was 70.8% after Jrue Holiday's offensive rebound with 1:37 remaining in the 4th quarter.\n",

    "On the Boston Celtics' side, I think they could've done a better job in the last possession execution. Only one screen was set, and there was no movement to get open. It allowed New York to strip the ball and prevent even a Shot Attempt. In addition, I'm not sure what bringing the ball down low in that situation would bring when Brown caught the ball. It exposed the ball too much to a long and defensive-beast in Mikal Bridges. A cross-court pass was too dangerous in that situation. I would've liked to see a curl screen toward the ball instead of flaring out. Even at the end of regulation, Boston tried a post-up, fadeaway, contested three that went nowhere. An alleyoop layup might've had a better chance than that play call. In this situations, I'm reminded of Paul Westphal's end-of-game play call to win against Portland where Oliver Miller inbounded against the backboard and Charles Barkley grabbed the ball from the floor for quick layup to win the game. \n",

    "Overall, New York played amazing defense to close out Game 1 in dramatic fashion. I believe Boston's Possession with 4:26 remaining in Overtime sums up New York's playstyle throughout the end of the game: suffocating and unrelating defense. They denied Boston of any momentum, and they positioned themselves for an 8-2 run in which they did not look back."
