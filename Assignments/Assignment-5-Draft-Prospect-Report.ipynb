    "# Assignment 5: Draft Prospect Report\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "Using the 2024-2025 D1 Dataset, create a report on a **draft prospect** evaulating their strengths, weaknesses, projected output, and fit with an existing team.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "- Choose one player from the 2024-2025 Division 1 Dataset\n",
    "- Analyse Usage & Efficiency: Include key metrics (USG%, eFG%, TS%, turnover rate, etc.) and write 2–3 sentences interpreting what these numbers tell you about:\n",
    "  - The player’s offensive role\n",
    "  - Their scoring effectiveness\n",
    "  - Context (team style, pace, lineup fit if relevant)\n",
    "- Pull Key Metrics by Category\n",
    "- For each bucket below, choose relevant stats from the dataset and include 1–2 sentences of interpretation (what the numbers mean, not just what they are):\n",
    "  - Shooting (e.g., 3P%, FT%, rim finishing, midrange volume, assisted vs. unassisted shots)\n",
    "  - Creation (assist rate, turnover rate, pick-and-roll involvement, self-creation indicators)\n",
    "  - Defense (steal%, block%, foul rate, defensive rebounding, matchup difficulty)\n",
    "  - Rebounding (ORB%, DRB%, positional comparison if applicable)\n",
    "- Position Group Comparison: Compare each prospect to peers at the same position (e.g., guards vs. guards). Include 1–2 sentences explaining:\n",
    "  - Does this prospect stand out? Are they average? Does their skill profile fit their positional archetype?\n",
    "- Strengths & Weaknesses Summary: Provide a concise final assessment summarising:\n",
    "  - What this player does well\n",
    "  - Main concerns or limitations\n",
    "  - Any quick projection (e.g., role, developmental focus)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission\n",
    "- Format & Length\n",
    "  - 1 Page or 2 Slides Maximum\n",
    "  - Include tables, shot charts, or bullet lists, if useful\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suggested Structure\n",

    "**Header: Player Name | Position | College | Class Year**\n",
